# Vast.ai API client

A minimal Python client and CLI for the [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai) REST API.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Authentication

The client reads your API key from the `VAST_API_KEY` environment variable.
It is never hardcoded in the source and never written to logs.

```bash
export VAST_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

Get or rotate your key at <https://console.vast.ai/account/>. Treat the key
like a password: don't commit it, don't paste it into chats or issues. If a
key is ever exposed, rotate it immediately.

## Usage

```bash
python vastai_client.py whoami
python vastai_client.py offers --max-price 0.5 --gpu-name RTX_4090
python vastai_client.py instances
python vastai_client.py create 1234567 --image pytorch/pytorch --disk 20
python vastai_client.py destroy 9876543
```

You can also import the client in your own code:

```python
from vastai_client import VastClient

client = VastClient()          # reads VAST_API_KEY
offers = client.search_offers(max_price=0.5)
```

## Notes

- Endpoints target the Vast.ai v0 API (`https://console.vast.ai/api/v0`).
  Verify request/response shapes against the current
  [API docs](https://docs.vast.ai/api/), as the API evolves.
- `create` and `destroy` cost real money / terminate real machines. Test with
  `offers` and `instances` (read-only) first.
